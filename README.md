## 👫🏾 Team Roles.

- 👨🏽‍💻 Backend Developer Role
The backend developer is responsible for designing and implementing the server-side logic of the application. This includes building secure and scalable APIs using Django, modeling the relational database in MySQL, and integrating authentication and authorization mechanisms. The role also involves collaborating on system architecture, ensuring data integrity, and setting up CI/CD pipelines for smooth deployment. A strong focus is placed on performance, security, and maintainability.

## 🗃️ Database Design

This project models a real-world booking platform, with entities that reflect key user and business interactions. Below are the primary entities and their relationships:

### 🔹 Users
Represents platform users (guests and hosts).
- `id` – Unique identifier
- `name` – Full name of the user
- `email` – Used for login and communication
- `role` – Either "guest" or "host"
- `created_at` – Account creation timestamp

### 🔹 Properties
Represents the listings that users can book.
- `id` – Unique identifier
- `title` – Name or headline of the property
- `description` – Detailed property overview
- `location` – City or region
- `host_id` – References the user who owns the property

**Relationship:** A user (host) can own multiple properties.

### 🔹 Bookings
Represents reservations made by guests.
- `id` – Unique identifier
- `property_id` – References the booked property
- `user_id` – References the guest making the booking
- `start_date` – Booking start date
- `end_date` – Booking end date

**Relationship:** A booking belongs to one user and one property.

### 🔹 Reviews
Represents feedback left by guests after a stay.
- `id` – Unique identifier
- `user_id` – Reviewer (guest)
- `property_id` – Property being reviewed
- `rating` – Numeric score
- `comment` – Optional written feedback

**Relationship:** A user can leave many reviews; a property can have many reviews.

### 🔹 Payments
Represents completed booking payments.
- `id` – Unique identifier
- `booking_id` – References the booking
- `amount` – Total amount paid
- `payment_method` – e.g., card, PayPal
- `status` – e.g., success, failed

**Relationship:** Each payment is linked to a single booking.

---

### 🔗 Entity Relationships Overview

- One **user** can be both a **guest** and a **host**.
- One **user** (host) can own many **properties**.
- One **property** can have many **bookings** and **reviews**.
- One **booking** is made by one **guest** and linked to one **property**.
- One **review** is tied to one **user** and one **property**.
- One **payment** is tied to one **booking**.

## ✨ Feature Breakdown

This project replicates the core functionality of a modern booking platform, focusing on usability, data integrity, and secure interactions. Below are the key features:

### 👤 User Management
Handles user registration, login, and role-based access (guest or host). This ensures secure authentication and proper authorization for actions such as property creation or booking.

### 🏠 Property Management
Allows hosts to list, update, or remove properties with detailed information such as location, pricing, and availability. This feature powers the platform’s core listing functionality and supports discoverability.

### 📆 Booking System
Enables guests to view available dates and make bookings for selected properties. It ensures accurate date management, prevents overlapping reservations, and facilitates smooth reservation workflows.

### 💳 Payment Integration
Processes booking payments securely, capturing transaction details and payment status. This feature simulates real-world payment flows and supports future scalability into actual payment gateways.

### ⭐ Reviews & Ratings
Lets guests leave feedback and rate properties after their stay. This builds trust in the platform by enabling user-generated quality assessments and informing future guests.

### 🔒 API Security & Validation
Implements authentication, authorization, input validation, and error handling across all endpoints. This guards the application against common vulnerabilities and ensures a safe user experience.

### 🚀 CI/CD & Deployment
Includes automated build, test, and deployment pipelines using Docker and GitHub Actions. This ensures code quality, reduces manual errors, and supports faster, more reliable releases.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is a core pillar of this project, ensuring user trust, data integrity, and safe transactions. The following measures are implemented to protect the application and its users:

### ✅ Authentication
All API requests require secure authentication using token-based mechanisms (e.g., JWT). This ensures only verified users can access protected routes and perform actions like bookings or property creation.

**Why it matters:** Prevents unauthorized access to personal data and sensitive user actions.

### 🔒 Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced throughout the system. For example, only hosts can manage properties, and only guests can make bookings or leave reviews.

**Why it matters:** Ensures users can only perform actions relevant to their roles, reducing abuse and system misuse.

### 📉 Rate Limiting
Limits the number of requests per user/IP to prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, or denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.

**Why it matters:** Maintains application stability and protects backend resources from being overwhelmed.

### 🧼 Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection or XSS.

**Why it matters:** Ensures the backend only processes clean, expected input and guards against data corruption and vulnerabilities.

### 🛑 Error Handling & Logging
Sensitive error details are hidden from users, and meaningful logs are recorded for monitoring and debugging.

**Why it matters:** Prevents leakage of system internals while giving developers visibility into issues for proactive response.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. They ensure that changes are delivered quickly, reliably, and with minimal manual effort, a critical requirement for scalable and collaborative software projects.

For this project, CI/CD pipelines are used to:
- Automatically run tests and lint code on every commit or pull request
- Build and containerize the application using Docker
- Deploy updates to the development or production environment with minimal downtime

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions** – Automates workflows for testing and deployment
- **Docker** – Ensures consistent environments across development and production
- **(Optional)** – Integration with cloud services like AWS or Heroku for deployment
